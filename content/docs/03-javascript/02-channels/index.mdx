import { ChannelAPI } from "./channel-api";

We recommend reading what [channels](/docs/getting-started/what-is-Fungi#channels) are before continuing.

The client below will be used in the examples.

```js
// fungi.js
import { Client } from "@fungi-realtime/core";

let client = new Client({
  // Fungi's WebSocket API is running on port 8081
  endpoint: "ws://localhost:8081",
});

export { client };
```

## Subscribing to a channel

To become a subscriber of a [public channel](/docs/getting-started/what-is-Fungi#public-channels) or a [private channel](/docs/getting-started/what-is-Fungi#private-channels) you call the `client.subscribe(channelName)` method. This method **returns the channel** you want to subscribe to so you can do things on the channel such as binding to events which means doing something whenever you receive an event on the channel.

### Subscribing to a public channel

We'll use the client we exported in the previous snippet.

```js
// index.js
import { client } from "./fungi";

let coolChannel = client.subscribe("cool-channel");
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

### Subscribing to a private channel

Read how [authentication](/docs/core-concepts/authentication) works before continuing.

You subscribe to [private channels](/docs/getting-started/what-is-Fungi#private-channels) the same way you subscribe to public channels except private channels are authenticated channels which means you need to tell the SDK where this authentication will take place.

```diff-js
  // fungi.js
  import { Client } from "@fungi-realtime/core";

  let client = new Client({
    // Fungi's WebSocket API is running on port 8081
    endpoint: "ws://localhost:8081",
+
+   // In this example, there's a server running on port 3000
+   // which performs the authentication required to subscribe
+   // to a private channel.
+   auth: {
+     endpoint: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/fungi'
+   }
  });

  export { client };
```

If you need to pass extra headers to your server so it can complete this authentication process, you can do so in the `Client` config.

```diff-js
  // fungi.js
  import { Client } from "@fungi-realtime/core";

  let client = new Client({
    // Fungi's WebSocket API is running on port 8081
    endpoint: "ws://localhost:8081",

    // In this example, there's a server running on port 3000
    // which performs the authentication required to subscribe
    // to a private channel.
    auth: {
      endpoint: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/fungi',
+     headers: {
+       Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('access_token')}`
+     }
    }
  });

  export { client };
```

Now that the SDK knows how to authenticate channel subscriptions, you can go ahead and subscribe to a private channel.

```js
// index.js
import { client } from "./fungi";

// Remember to prefix the channel name with "private-"
let coolChannel = client.subscribe("private-cool-channel");
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

## Triggering events on a channel

TODO

## Channel API

When you subscribe to a channel, a `Channel` object which represents the channel you're subscribing to is returned, this is the API for that object.

<ChannelAPI />
