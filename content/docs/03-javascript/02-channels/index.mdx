import { ChannelAPI } from "./channel-api";

We recommend reading what [channels](/docs/01-getting-started/01-overview#channels) are before continuing.

The client below will be used in the examples.

```js
// fungi.js
import { Client } from "@fungi-realtime/core";

let client = new Client({
  // Fungi's WebSocket API is running on port 8081
  endpoint: "ws://localhost:8081",
});

export { client };
```

## Subscribing to a channel

To become a subscriber of a [public channel](/docs/01-getting-started/01-overview#public-channels) or a [private channel](/docs/01-getting-started/01-overview#private-channels) you call the `client.subscribe(channelName)` method. This method **returns the channel** you're subscribing to.

### Subscribing to a public channel

We'll use the client we created at the beggining of this page.

```js
// index.js
import { client } from "./fungi";

let coolChannel = client.subscribe("cool-channel");
```

That's it! 🎉

### Subscribing to a private channel

We recommend reading how [authentication](/docs/02-core-concepts/01-authentication) works before continuing.

You subscribe to [private channels](/docs/01-getting-started/01-overview#private-channels) the same way you subscribe to public channels except these are authenticated channels which means you need to tell the SDK where the authentication will take place. You will need your own server to authenticate these subscriptions, you can take a look at an example in Node [here](/docs/04-node/03-authenticating-clients).

```diff-js
  // fungi.js
  import { Client } from "@fungi-realtime/core";

  let client = new Client({
    // Fungi's WebSocket API is running on port 8081
    endpoint: "ws://localhost:8081",
+
+   // In this example, there's a server running on port 3000
+   // which authenticates subscriptions.
+   auth: {
+     endpoint: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/fungi'
+   }
  });

  export { client };
```

If you need to pass extra headers to your server so it can complete this authentication process, you can do so in the `Client` config.

```diff-js
  // fungi.js
  import { Client } from "@fungi-realtime/core";

  let client = new Client({
    // Fungi's WebSocket API is running on port 8081
    endpoint: "ws://localhost:8081",

    // In this example, there's a server running on port 3000
    // which authenticates subscriptions.
    auth: {
      endpoint: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/fungi',
+     headers: {
+       Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('access_token')}` // 😬 localStorage
+     }
    }
  });

  export { client };
```

Now that the SDK knows how to authenticate channel subscriptions, you can go ahead and subscribe to a private channel.

```js
// index.js
import { client } from "./fungi";

// Remember to prefix the channel name with "private-"
let coolChannel = client.subscribe("private-cool-channel");
```

That's it! 🎉

## Triggering events on a channel

TODO

## Channel API

When you subscribe to a channel, a `Channel` object which represents the channel you're subscribing to is returned, this is the API for that object.

<ChannelAPI />
