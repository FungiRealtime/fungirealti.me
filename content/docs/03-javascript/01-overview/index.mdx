The JavaScript SDK is meant to be used by [clients](/docs/getting-started/what-is-Fungi#clients). The SDK works on both the browser and the server though it's mostly used on the client side of web applications (React, Vue, Angular, etc).

## Requirements

- Fungi API's running, read the [installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) guide.

- A server-side API from where you can trigger events, if you're also using JavaScript for the server (Node), read the [node](/docs/node/overview) guide.

## Features

- **Resilient & stable**. Automatic reconnection of websocket connection upon unexpected errors, health checks and more to keep the user always online.
- **Environment agnostic**. Works on both the browser and Node, the native [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) API will be used on browsers and [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) on Node.

## Installation

This SDK is distributed via [npm](https://npmjs.com/) which is bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org/) and should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install @fungi-realtime/core
```

## Usage

Your client application should share a single `Client` which represents a Fungi [client](/docs/getting-started/what-is-Fungi#clients), we'll create a new file `fungi.js` where we create a new `Client` and export it so the rest of the application can use it.

```js
// fungi.js
import { Client } from "@fungi-realtime/core";

let client = new Client({
  // Fungi's WebSocket API is running on port 8081
  endpoint: "ws://localhost:8081",
});

export { client };
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
