The JavaScript SDK is meant to be used by [clients](/docs/01-getting-started/01-overview#clients). The SDK works on both the browser and the server.

## Requirements

- Fungi's APIs installed and running, read the [installation](/docs/01-getting-started/02-installation) guide.

- A server-side API from where you can trigger events, if you're also using JavaScript for the server (Node), read the [node](/docs/04-node/01-overview) guide.

## Features

- **Resilient & stable**. Automatic reconnection of websocket connection upon unexpected errors, health checks and more to keep the user always online.
- **Environment agnostic**. Works on both the browser and Node, the native [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) API will be used on browsers and we'll fallback to [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) in case the native API is not available.

## Installation

This SDK is distributed via [npm](https://npmjs.com/) which is bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org/) and should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install @fungi-realtime/core
```

## Creating a client

The first thing you need is a `FungiClient`. Your client application should share a single `FungiClient` instance which represents a Fungi [client](/docs/01-getting-started/01-overview#clients), we'll create a new file `fungi.js` where we create a new `FungiClient` and export it so the rest of the application can import it and use it.

```js
// fungi.js
import { FungiClient } from "@fungi-realtime/core";

let fungi = new FungiClient("ws://localhost:8080");

export { fungi };
```

That's it, once you instantiate the client, a WebSocket connection will be established between your app and Fungi's APIs! ðŸŽ‰
