## Get your license credentials

You can find your license credentials in the [dashboard](/dashboard). If you don't own a license you'll have to [buy one](/pricing). Head over to the "License" section at the bottom of the dashboard where you will find the license key as well as the username (Owner). Make a note of those details, you will need them later.

The license key is confidential and belongs to your account, make sure you don't commit it to open source projects or any other publicly available resource. If you believe your license key was leaked, [contact support](/support) and we'll give you a new one.

## Next steps

Now that you have your license credentials, you can continue with an [overview](/docs/01-getting-started/01-overview) of what Fungi is and some core concepts.
