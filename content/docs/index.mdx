Before we get started you'll need a license to follow along. If you
don't have one, you can get one [here](/pricing).

Once you purchase a license, you'll receive an email from GitHub with an
invitation to our organization, go ahead and accept it, this will
allow you to use our product and get support from the community. If
you haven't received an invitation, go ahead and [submit a request to support](/support).
