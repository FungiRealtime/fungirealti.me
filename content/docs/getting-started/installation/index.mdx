## Requirements

- [A license](/pricing). In order to use Fungi's products, you must be a member of our GitHub org and the only way to join it is by purchasing a license, read the [getting started](/docs) doc to learn more.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You can run Fungi anywhere it's available. This documentation assumes you're familiar with it and its ecosystem.

- [Redis](https://redis.io/). You must run a redis instance locally to which Fungi will connect and use for communication. You can use Docker to run redis since you'll be needing it either way.

## Overview

Fungi has **2 core components**, each of them a Docker container that you need to run locally:

- **WebSocket API**. This is the most important component, it allows clients to connect to it and receive realtime updates.
- **REST API**. Used for actions such as sending realtime messages to the WebSocket API so that clients can receive them.

Go ahead and [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if you haven't already. Once it's installed, you'll have to login to **GitHub's Container Registry** which is where all of Fungi's component's docker images are stored.

## Logging in to GitHub's Container Registry

1. Get a GitHub personal access token (PAT). Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create one and make sure you select the `read:packages` scope.

2. Login with Docker using the PAT from the previous step:

```sh
$ echo $PAT | docker login ghcr.io --username github-username --password-stdin
```

You should see a `Login succeeded` message on your terminal if the login was successful.

3. Docker is ready! üê≥

## With Docker Compose

You can use any Docker tool you'd like to set up Fungi, we'll use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for simplicity. Here's a sample `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  rest:
    image: ghcr.io/fungirealtime/rest:1.0.0
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      REDIS_URL: redis://:myredispassword@redis:6379/
      APP_SECRET: app-test-secret
      APP_KEY: app-test-key

  ws:
    image: ghcr.io/fungirealtime/ws:1.0.0
    ports:
      - 8081:8080
    environment:
      REDIS_URL: redis://:myredispassword@redis:6379/
      APP_SECRET: app-test-secret
      APP_KEY: app-test-key

  redis:
    image: redis:6
    command: redis-server --requirepass myredispassword
```

Once you run `docker-compose up` Fungi's REST API will be available on port 8080 and Fungi's WebSocket API on port 8081 (you can publish any port you want), both Fungi services listen on port 8080 internally by default.

We also run a redis instance like mentioned in the [requirements](#requirements).

## Environment variables

Each Fungi component has its own set of environment variables at runtime but there's also some environment variables which all components use, these are:

- `PORT`: The port on which the component (REST API, WebSocket API) will listen on internally. Default is 8080.
- `APP_KEY`: String generated by you used for authorized requests and resources, recommended minimum length is 32 characters.
- `REDIS_URL`: The full URL to the redis instance. It must use the [standard scheme](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/redis).

### WebSocket API component environment variables

- `APP_SECRET`: String generated by you used for authorizing private channels, recommended minimum length is 32 characters. This is used in conjuction with the `APP_KEY` to create secure authentication signatures.
- `SOCKETS_LIMIT_PER_SECOND`: Maximum events allowed per second to be sent by each websocket client, ping messages are included. Default is 10. We don't recommend changing this as 10 is a good default.
