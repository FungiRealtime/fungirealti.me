## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You can run Fungi anywhere Docker is available. This documentation assumes you're familiar with the basics.

## Overview

Fungi is available as a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/fungirt/engine) which includes a highly scalable WebSocket API and a powerful REST API.

- **WebSocket API**. This is the most important API, it allows realtime communication between [clients](/docs/01-getting-started/01-overview#clients). Internally it uses [ÂµWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) which powers the trading APIs of [Bitfinex.com](https://bitfinex.com) and [Kraken.com](https://kraken.com), handling volumes of multiple billions of USD every day. Other companies include [Trello](https://trello.com/), where ÂµWebSockets is serving their 50 million users with real-time board updates.

- **REST API**. This is the main point of interaction with your servers. The most important aspect of this is [server events](/docs/01-getting-started/01-overview#server-events). All interaction with this API must contain your [app's key](#environment-variables).

## With Docker Compose

You can use any Docker tool you'd like to set up Fungi but we'll use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for simplicity. Here's a sample `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  engine:
    image: fungirt/engine
    ports:
      # Map the port 8080 from the host to the container
      # which is Fungi's default listening port.
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      APP_SECRET: my-super-secret-app-secret
      APP_KEY: my-super-secret-app-key
```

Once you run `docker-compose up` Fungi's APIs will be available on port 8080 and ready to go! ðŸŽ‰

## Environment variables

There are all of Fungi's environment variables (required ones will be suffixed with a `*`):

- `APP_SECRET`\*: String generated by you used for authorizing private channels subscriptions, recommended minimum length is 32 characters. This is used in conjuction with the `APP_KEY` to create secure authentication signatures. You can generate a secure one [here](https://1password.com/password-generator/).

- `APP_KEY`\*: String generated by you used for authorizing requests to the [REST API](#overview), recommended minimum length is 32 characters. You can generate a secure one [here](https://1password.com/password-generator/).

- `PORT`: The port on which the API will listen on internally. Default is 8080.

- `REDIS_URL`: The connection URL for a Redis server. It must use the [standard scheme](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/redis). Setting this environment variable will enable cluster mode which will allow you to run multiple instances of Fungi's APIs and scale horizontally. The Redis server must support [Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub).

- `SOCKETS_LIMIT_PER_SECOND`: Maximum events allowed per second to be sent by each websocket client, [ping events](/docs/01-getting-started/01-overview#system-events) are included. Default is 10. We don't recommend setting a higher value than 10 because clients shouldn't be sending that much data anyway.
