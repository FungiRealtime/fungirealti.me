## Requirements

- [A license](/pricing). In order to use Fungi's APIs, you must own a license, if you don't have one, you can get it [here](/pricing).

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You can run Fungi anywhere Docker is available. This documentation assumes you're familiar with the basics.

- [Redis](https://redis.io/). You must run a redis instance locally to which Fungi will connect and use for communication. You can use Docker to run redis since you'll be needing it either way.

## Overview

Fungi has 2 APIs, each of them a Docker container that you need to run locally:

- **WebSocket API**. This is the most important component, it allows clients to connect to it and receive realtime updates.
- **REST API**. Used for actions such as sending realtime messages to the WebSocket API so that clients can receive them.

Go ahead and [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if you haven't already. Once it's installed, you'll have to login to **Fungi's Docker Registry** which is where all of Fungi's APIs images are stored.

## Logging in to Fungi's Docker Registry

1. Get your license credentials, follow the instructions [here](/docs#get-your-license-credentials).

2. [Login with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) using the credentials from the previous step:

```sh
# We've set an environment variable "FUNGI_LICENSE_KEY" with the license key as the value. That is the recommended approach with security in mind although you can directly echo it.
echo $FUNGI_LICENSE_KEY | docker login dkr.fungirealti.me --username license-username --password-stdin
```

You should see a `Login Succeeded` message on your terminal if the login was successful.

3. Docker is ready! üê≥

## With Docker Compose

You can use any Docker tool you'd like to set up Fungi but we'll use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for simplicity. Here's a sample `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  rest:
    image: dkr.fungirealti.me/rest:1.0.0
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      REDIS_URL: redis://:myredispassword@redis:6379/
      APP_SECRET: app-test-secret
      APP_KEY: app-test-key

  ws:
    image: dkr.fungirealti.me/ws:1.0.0
    ports:
      - 8081:8080
    environment:
      REDIS_URL: redis://:myredispassword@redis:6379/
      APP_SECRET: app-test-secret
      APP_KEY: app-test-key

  redis:
    image: redis:6
    command: redis-server --requirepass myredispassword
```

Once you run `docker-compose up` Fungi's REST API will be available on port 8080 and Fungi's WebSocket API on port 8081, both Fungi APIs listen on port 8080 internally by default.

We also run a redis instance like mentioned in the [requirements](#requirements).

## Environment variables

Each Fungi API has its own set of environment variables at runtime but there's also some environment variables which all APIs use, these are:

- `PORT`: The port on which the API will listen on internally. Default is 8080.
- `APP_KEY`: String generated by you used for authorizing requests, recommended minimum length is 32 characters.
- `REDIS_URL`: The full URL to the redis instance. It must use the [standard scheme](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/redis).

### WebSocket API

- `APP_SECRET`: String generated by you used for authorizing private channels subscriptions, recommended minimum length is 32 characters. This is used in conjuction with the `APP_KEY` to create secure authentication signatures.
- `SOCKETS_LIMIT_PER_SECOND`: Maximum events allowed per second to be sent by each websocket client, ping messages are included. Default is 10. We don't recommend changing this as 10 is a good default.

### REST API

The REST API has no specific environment variables other than the [common ones](#environment-variables).
