## Categories

Fungi's SDKs are divided into 2 categories:

- **Client**. Client SDKs connect to [Fungi's WebSocket API](/docs/01-getting-started/02-installation#overview). These SDKs should be used by a web browser or any other client application.

- **Server**. Server SDKs interact with [Fungi's REST API](/docs/01-getting-started/02-installation#overview) and **authenticate channel subscriptions**. They should be used in a secure environment because they require your app's [secret and key](/docs/01-getting-started/02-installation#environment-variables).

### Client SDKs
