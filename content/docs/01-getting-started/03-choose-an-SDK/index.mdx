## Categories

Fungi's SDKs are divided into 2 categories:

- **Client**. Client SDKs consume Fungi's APIs using a [WebSocket interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).

- **Server**. Server SDKs interact with Fungi's REST API, **publish messages** and **authenticate channel subscriptions**. They should be used in a secure environment because they require sensitive application credentials.

### Client SDKs

The following client SDKs are updated and supported by us.

## Community SDKs

You're more than welcome to create an SDK for a platform we don't yet support. If you need any help or technical details to create the SDK, feel free to [reach out to us](/support).
