Fungi is a **set of APIs and SDKs** that help you build realtime features. These APIs are self-hosted and run in Docker containers. In this page you'll find all the concepts you need to know to start building realtime apps with Fungi.

## Clients

You'll see the term **client** being used all over the place, when we say client we refer to an user of your application (authenticated or not) with an active connection to Fungi's APIs.

An **active connection** is an established [WebSocket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) connection between a web browser (or any other client application) and Fungi's APIs.

## Channels

Channels are like **rooms** that clients can join and leave at any time, when a client joins a room, they become **subscribers** of the channel and can talk to every subscriber of the channel with [events](#events). These are some of the characteristics about channels:

- Each channel has a **unique name**, this means that there can't be more than 1 channel with the same name. A channel name can't be longer than 200 characters.
- Channels **don't have a capacity** so there can be as many subscribers as required by the application.
- There's 2 types of channels, [public channels](#public-channels) and [private channels](#private-channels).

### Public channels

These are channels that **anyone can join**, they're perfect for things like cryptocurrency statistics, public rooms for chat applications, etc.

Examples of public channels names:

- `my-public-channel`
- `cryptocurrency-stats`
- `global-chat-room-1`

### Private channels

These channels are **private** like the name suggests, in order for a client to subscribe to one, they first must be **authorized** by your application and their name must be prefixed with `private-`. They're perfect for things like private chat rooms, direct messaging, voice calls, etc.

Examples of private channels names:

- `private-app`
- `private-call-123`
- `private-room-456`

## Events

Events are **mainly used to communicate between subscribers of the same channel**, for example in a messaging app, an event would be sent from a subscriber to tell the rest of subscribers that they have performed an action like sending a message.

- An event can be sent to one or more (up to 10) channels at once.
- An event must carry a payload (the data). The payload can't be larger than 10 KB.
- An event must have a name which identifies it, for example if your application has a feature of sending messages, the event's name for a new message could be `new-message`. An event name can't be longer than 200 characters.
- There's 3 types of events, [server events](#server-events), [client events](#client-events) and [system events](#system-events).

### Server events

This is the perfect type of event if you need validation or persistence because these events will always go through your server before being sent.

A server SDK is required to send server events, they allow you send events on public and private channels though Fungi's REST API. These events can only be sent from a secure environment because server SDKs require sensitive application credentials.

Examples of server events names:

- `new-message`
- `new-friend-request`
- `joined-voice-call`

### Client events

Not all events need to go through a server since some actions may not require validation or persistence and that's what client events are for, the events will be sent through a WebSocket connection. An example of this can be a realtime collaboration app in which users can see eachother's cursor position.

_It is important that you be careful when using client events because they originate from other users and they could be malicious users._

Client events have the following **restrictions**:

- Client events can only be triggered on [private channels](#private-channels) because they require authentication.
- Client events must be prefixed with `client-`. Events with any other prefix can't be sent as a client event.
- Client events can only be sent on channels to which the user is subscribed to. For example if the user Alice is subscribed only to the channel `private-channel-1`, this user will only be able to send client events on the channel `private-channel-1`.
- Each client can publish up to 10 client events per second. This can be [configured](/docs/getting-started/installation#websocket-api) in our APIs.

Examples of client events names:

- `client-cursor-moved`
- `client-clicked`

### System events

These events are sent by Fungi's APIs to notify the client SDK of some action.
