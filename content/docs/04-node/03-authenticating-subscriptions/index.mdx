We recommend reading how [authentication](/docs/02-core-concepts/01-authentication) works in Fungi before continuing.

You use the `authenticate(socketId: string, channelName: string)` method to generate an [auth token](/docs/02-core-concepts/01-authentication#the-auth-token) for a specific client and channel,

```js
import { Client } from "@fungi-realtime/node";

// We don't pass the httpEndpoint to the client because it's not required
// if all we're doing is authentication.
let client = new Client({
  key: "app-test-key",
  secret: "app-test-secret",
});

let socketId = "123";
let channelName = "cool-channel";

let auth = client.authenticate(socketId, channelName);
console.log(auth);
// {
//   auth: "xxxxxxx:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
// }
```

The example above isn't very practical because normally you receive the socket's id and channel name from your client application (via some [client SDK](/docs/01-getting-started/03-choose-an-SDK#client-sdks)). For that reason we'll show an example using `express` and an endpoint which authenticates every incoming request. In a real world app you should first check that the user has permission for the channel and then authenticate it with Fungi.

```js
// server.js
const express = require("express");
const { Client } = require("@fungi-realtime/node");

let app = express();

let client = new Client({
  key: "app-test-key",
  secret: "app-test-secret",
});

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/fungi/auth", (req, res) => {
  let socketId = req.body.socket_id;
  let channel = req.body.channel_name;
  let auth = client.authenticate(socketId, channel);
  res.json(auth);
});

let port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port);
```

You can read more about the endpoint implementation [here](/docs/02-core-concepts/01-authentication#server-side-endpoint-implementation).
