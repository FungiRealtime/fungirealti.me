import { Warning } from "./warning";

The Node SDK should be used by a secure environment like your app's server because it requires your app's credentials and allows you to perform more "privileged" actions.

## Features

- **Event batching**. Batch event triggers with an easy to use API.
- **Authentication**. Generate [auth tokens](/docs/02-core-concepts/01-authentication#the-auth-token) on your server to authenticate channel subscriptions.

## Installation

This SDK is distributed via [npm](https://npmjs.com/) which is bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org/) and should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install @fungi-realtime/node
```

## Creating a client

The first thing you need is a `Client`, you can have as many `Client` instances as you want but we recommend sharing a single instance across your server.

```js
// fungi.js
import { Client } from "@fungi-realtime/node";

let client = new Client({
  key: "app-test-key",
  secret: "app-test-secret",
});

export { client };
```

The above configuration passed to the client is enough if all you plan on doing is authenticating channel subscriptions, but if you plan to also trigger events, this requires communication between the SDK and [Fungi's REST API](/docs/01-getting-started/02-installation#overview) so you need to tell the SDK what the endpoint for Fungi's REST API is.

```diff-js
  // fungi.js
  import { Client } from "@fungi-realtime/node";

  let client = new Client({
    key: "app-test-key",
    secret: "app-test-secret",
+   // In this example, the REST API is running locally
+   // on port 8080.
+   httpEndpoint: "http://localhost:8080",
  });

  export { client };
```
